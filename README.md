🚀 Mobile Game Studio
Create Games. Create Movies. Anywhere.
Mobile Game Studio (MGS) is a mobile-first game engine + 3D creation + cinematic production platform that combines the power of Unreal Engine, Blender, and Substance Painter into a unified ecosystem.
Built for creators who want to develop games, films, and interactive experiences directly from mobile devices — with desktop-level power.
🎯 Vision
